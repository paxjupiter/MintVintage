                    <h1>Welcome to MintVintage!</h1>
                    <p>Ah, the glory of collectible cards — pristine treasures of your childhood dreams. Well… not here, buddy. At MintVintage, we're serving up the real deal: raw, ungraded, and unapologetically lived-in Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering cards straight from the deep dark recesses of a cardboard box in the back of my closet.</p>

                        <p>Are they in good condition? Yeah, sure, probably mostly. Mint? Nope. Museum-worthy? Nah. But do they have personality? Absolutely. Every crease tells a story, every scuff adds character, and every faint Cheeto dust stain is a reminder that these beauties survived the wild jungles of my erstwhile youth. Ok I pulled out all the creased ones. But full disclosure: these cards have been well-loved.</p>
                        
                        <p>Here's the deal: I played with every single one of these cards. Except Charizard, obviously. I screamed and wept and put him in a sleeve to rot for decades. You're not buying perfection; you're buying history. And truly - there are some real gems in here. Talkin' shadowless red-cheeks Pikachu. Talkin' misprinted Dark Arbok (1999-23000). Talkin' Ancient Mew (of course I opened it, I was like 12).</p> 
                            
                            <p>These cards are meant to be enjoyed. Seriously. I'm looking to sell to folks who will love them as much as I have over the years. Life's too short for PSA grades anyway.</p>

                        <h1>Looking for something specific?</h1>
                        <p>Reach out! Seriously I have like 5.3K cards and they're all inventoried. Hit me up!</p>
